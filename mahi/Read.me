To document the code and explain how to set up and run the application, you can follow these steps:

### Setting up the Spring Boot Backend:
1. **Controller (`Controller.java`):**
   - This class defines the REST endpoints for handling HTTP requests.
   - The `@PostMapping` annotation is used to handle HTTP POST requests to the `/api/c1/enter` endpoint, where it saves data received in the request body to the database using the `Serv` service.
   - The `@GetMapping` annotation is used to handle HTTP GET requests to the `/api/c1/getData` endpoint, where it retrieves data from the database using the `Serv` service.

2. **Modal (`Modal.java`):**
   - This class represents the data model for storing information in the database.
   - It defines the structure of the `studentInfo` table in the database using JPA annotations.

3. **Service (`Serv.java`):**
   - This class contains business logic for interacting with the database.
   - It uses the `Repo` repository to perform CRUD operations on the database.

### Setting up the React Frontend:
1. **Form Component (`Form.js`):**
   - This component defines a form for users to input data.
   - It uses the `useState` hook to manage form data and response messages.
   - The `handleChange` function updates form data as users input values.
   - The `handleSubmit` function sends a POST request to the backend API to save form data.
   - It conditionally renders the `Retrive` component based on user interaction.

2. **Retrive Component (`Retrive.js`):**
   - This component retrieves data from the backend API and displays it in a tabular format.
   - It likely uses the `useState` hook to manage retrieved data and possibly the `useEffect` hook to fetch data when the component mounts.
   - The data retrieved from the backend is displayed in an HTML table.

3. **Styling (`App.css`):**
   - This file contains CSS styles for styling the form and other UI elements.

### Running the Application:
1. **Backend:**
   - Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.
   - Navigate to the root directory of the Spring Boot project.
   - Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the Spring Boot server.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Navigate to the root directory of the React project.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the React development server.

3. **Accessing the Application:**
   - Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your backend API is running on `http://localhost:8080` or update the API URL in the React component accordingly.
- Handle any CORS issues by configuring CORS settings in your Spring Boot application if needed.
- Make sure your database connection is configured correctly in the Spring Boot application properties file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`).

By following these steps, you should be able to set up, run, and interact with your Spring Boot and React application successfully.
